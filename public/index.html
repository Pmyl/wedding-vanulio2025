                <div class="accommodation-place-description">The venue is a landmark of Nottingham and we are not going to lie here, it was quite pricey! <br />Jokes aside, we’ll love to have you at our house, right in our back garden! <br />From the city centre, the house is very easy to reach. If your accommodation is in the city centre, you could catch the 43 bus (red line) from <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/King+St,+Nottingham/@52.9543549,-1.1495312,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4879c3d5554cd33b:0x3dcb7b4c9323eb9c!8m2!3d52.9543549!4d-1.1495312!16s%2Fg%2F1tf1nbzl?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEyNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D'>King Street</a> and it will take you less than 20 minutes, the coach will drop you right in front of the house at Parkdale Road’s stop. <br />But if your shoes are not comfy enough for a small walk or if you feel lazy and you want to go for a taxi I’m not here to judge you. There are plenty of <a href='https://www.uber.com'>Uber</a> cars in the area! <br />In case you are planning to get here by car, you can park pretty much anywhere on our road and adjacent streets.</div>

The connection with Birmingham’s airport is quite good, we will advise you to get there by train, it will take you less than 2 hours to get to the city.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="accommodation-london-route-details">You can fly to London every day of the week from Pisa/Bologna but you can also look for some direct flights from Florence. Then, you can choose to stay for some days in the Capital and enjoy or go and reach Nottingham. You can take a bus with <a href='https://www.nationalexpress.com'>National Express</a> (4 hours ride for £25 pp) or a train with <a href='https://www.thetrainline.com'>Trainline</a> (2 hours ride for £65 pp). Try to book in advance from their website just to be sound and safe. When you grab the bus/train you'll reach the city centre with no fuss. Be sure to carry with you a nice book or music.</p>

                In Nottingham you'll find a lot of places to stay during your holidays. There are a bunch of hotels in the city centre (<a href='https://www.booking.com'>Booking</a>) with a good price range. For example Jury’s Inn is close to the station and a 10 minute walk from the main square; Ibis hotel is right in the city centre, just in front of the tram station... you got the gist of it!! If you are looking for a flat for you and your family in the city you can find some places on websites like <a href='https://www.airbnb.co.uk/'>Airbnb</a> or <a href='https://www.hometogo.co.uk'>hometogo</a>. <br />Some advice: try to book your accommodation in the city centre where you’ll have the easiest connections with transports (NG1) or somewhere on the 43 bus line. If you end up going to stay outside of the city keep in mind that the main transports are only from the centre so you’ll have to get there and catch another bus wherever else you’d like to go. <br />Also the city is quite beautiful and packed with restaurants, and we think you don’t want to miss it!!
