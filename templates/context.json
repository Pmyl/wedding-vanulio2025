From the city centre, the venue is very easy to reach: you can plan ahead and decide for a nice walk from your place it's a 15 minute walk from Jury’s Inn or 25 minute walk from Old Market Square (the main square). But if your shoes are not comfy enough for a small walk you can grab a bus from almost everywhere. The venue it's in a strategic place, we’ve thought of everything!! ...if you are lazy like me and you want to go for a taxi I’m not here to judge you. By the way if you are planning to get there by car remember to check it in inside the pub: you’ll need to insert your plate number in their device and there you have it!",

    "nottinghamRouteDescription": "The closest airport to Nottingham is East Midlands Airport and you can flight from Pisa on Wednesday and Sunday with Ryanair. The shortest trip would be coming here on the 30th of August and go back home on the 2nd of September. Then you can take a bus from the airport and in 45 minutes you'll be in the city centre. There are different options for your ticket like single, double or family, pay attention so you’ll not miss a friendly discount. On average the prices are around £5 pp, if you don't book it in advance through the Ryanair website be sure to have some change with you. If you are looking to share a ride with someone will be favourable to take an Uber or call for a taxi from the airport desk (you'll see the indication when you land, don't worry). The prices are around 20/30£ per ride to the city centre and it will take less than 30 minutes.",
    "londonRoute": "...in alternative you can also visit London",
    "londonRouteDescription": "You can flight to London almost every day of the week from Pisa/Bologna but you can also look for some direct flight from Florence. Then, you can choose to stay for some days in the Capital and enjoy or go and reach Nottingham. You can take a bus with National Express (4 hours ride for £25 pp) or a train with Trainline (2 hours ride for £65 pp). Try to book in advance from their website just to be sound and safe. When you grab the bus/train you'll reach the city centre with no fuss. Be sure to carry with you a nice book or music.",
    "accommodationStay": "In Nottingham you'll find a lot of places where to stay during your holidays. There are a bunch of hotels in the city centre with a good price range. For example Jury’s Inn is close to the station and 10 minute walk from the main square; Ibis hotel is right in the city centre, just in front of the tram station... you got the gist of it!! If you are looking for a flat for you and your family in the city you can find some places on websites like Airbnb.it or hometogo.com. Some advice: try to book in the city centre (NG1) because if you are getting further than NG3 you’ll be pretty far from the centre and then you’ll need a bus or a cab to reach the main tourist sites. Also the city it’s quite beautiful and I think you don’t want to miss it!! Here some top-rated tourist attractions in Nottingham!",
